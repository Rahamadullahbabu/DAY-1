1.Difference between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2 

HTTP 1.1
•	It works on the textual format
•	There is head pf line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
•	It uses requests resource in lining for use getting pages.
•	It compresses data by itself
•	Low performance

HTTP 2
•	It works on the binary protocol
•	It allows multiplexing so one TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection is required for multiple requests.
•	It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
•	It uses   Compressed file archive (HPack) for data compression
•	High performance


2.Objects and its internal representation in JavaScript

•	Objects have 1. type 2. attributes 3. Behaviour

•	A Java object is a member (also called an instance) of a Java class. Each object has an identity, a behaviour and a state. The state of an object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) display the object's behaviour. Objects are created at runtime from templates, which are also known as classes.

•	Objects in programming can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures. This means that objects can store values, you can use objects to manipulate values and combine them into more complex objects, like arrays and still get all the benefits. JavaScript is no different.


•	In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a mobile, for example. A mobile is an object, with properties. A mobile has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.
